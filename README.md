# DarkTideAHK

# v2.0rc1 - "Blessings of the Omnissiah"
- Shift + F4 to find the current position of the mouse, important for the next bit
- Now rather than positioning automatically based on resolution, the user can input the X and Y positions for more control
- Added a tooltip to show current reroll progress

## How To Use:
1. Install AutoHotKey v1.1: https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Install Capture2Text: https://capture2text.sourceforge.net/ 
3. Download **PerkReroll.ahk** from the repo
4. Turn on the script
5. Go to DarkTide refine item screen
6. Use {Shift + F4} to find the current mouse position so you can fill in the arguments in the script
7. Save and re-run the script (you can right click the "H" in system tray)
8. **IMPORTANT: DO NOT HAVE THE PERK SELECTED**, the script will do this automatically
9. Press {Shift + F1} to start the script
    9b. {Shift + F2} can be used to toggle the script on/off
    9c. {Shift + F3} will disable close the .ahk file entirely
    9d. {Shift + F4} to find the current mouse position so you can fill in the arguments in the script

- Note Capture2Text default OCR keybind is Win + Q so uh don't use those buttons for something else

## To Do:
- Adjust default proportions for different resolutions, UI scaling
    - or automate it idk
- Pictures in guide
- Allow RegEx mode to deal with weird string issues
- Allow custom Capture2Text keybind
- (Suggestions welcome)
