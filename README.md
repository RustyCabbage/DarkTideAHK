# DarkTideAHK
 
## v1.1.2 "It was in fact, not serviceable. But now is (hopefully)."

## How To Use:
1. Install AutoHotKey v1.1: https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Install Capture2Text: https://capture2text.sourceforge.net/ 
3. Download PerkReroll.ahk from the repo
4. Edit script with your game resolution, desired perk
    4b. Be wary that depending on your resolution the picture-to-text might not correctly capture the string
5. Turn on the script
6. Go to DarkTide refine item screen
7. Press {Shift + F1} to start the script
    7b. {Shift + F2} can be used to toggle the script on/off
    7c. {Shift + F3} will disable close the .ahk file entirely

- Note Capture2Text default OCR keybind is Win + Q so uh don't use those buttons for something else

## To Do:
- Adjust default proportions for different resolutions, UI scaling
    - or automate it idk
- Pictures in guide
- Allow RegEx mode to deal with weird string issues
- Allow custom Capture2Text keybind
- (Suggestions welcome)
